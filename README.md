# Krin Sranan

This is the 2021 submission of Anton de Kom Universiteit Suriname's GDSC club for the 2021 GDSC solution challenge. It addresses the following Sustainable Development goals:

1. sustainable cities and  communities
2. Climate action
2. life below water

It tries to address these by doing the following:
1. Making people aware of recycling and where they can do it in Suriname.
2. Organizing cleanup days to reduce the amount of unrecycled waste, preventing these from poluting land and water, as well as promoting responsible disposal of resources after consumption.
3. Collecting data on which locations have problems with waste disposal, allowing policy makers to make better decisions based on data.

# Usage

To install the app, you must enable installation from untrusted sources and then download the latest version from the releases selection in this repository. This won't be needed in the future. The app is currently installed with the name "Screens".

## Request NGO Status

Having NGO status is needed to organize cleanup days. To do this, log out if you're logged in already, and select the "Request NGO status" option. This will open up an email form, requesting to be added with an elevated role. You will be logged in as a normal user after the email has been sent.  We will then add your account as an NGO as soon as possible. When that is done, the next time you open the app, more options will be available to you.

## Join an Event

1. Select "All Events" from the drawer. You will then see all open and closed events. Events which you have joined already are surrounded with a green border.
2. Select the event you want to join. The description can be expanded by clicking on "Description", and the location can be viewed by clicking "View location". You can also swipe left on the pictures to see more pictures, if any.
3. Click join.
4. You have joined the event. You will get a notification the day before the event happens as a reminder, as well as when the organizer updates something related to the event.

## View Recycling Bins

Open up the drawer and select recycle bins. This should show you all recycling bins Suresur has added. The waste collected at these locations is cleaned regularly and recycled as much as possible.

## Create an Event

1. Click the "Organize" option visible in the lower right corner of the screen.
2. Pick a date and time for the event.
3. Pick a location.
4. Fill in the title. It should contain the location of the event.
5. Fill in the description. This should contain the information such as the gathering point, which equipment you'll bring, which equipment the people joining your event should bring and other information you think is relevant.
6. Make some pictures of the area you plan to clean on the cleanup day.
7. Click "Send".

You should track how much waste is collected and what types of waste, as well as making some pictures of the location after it has been cleaned.
After the event has passed, you will get a notification to wrap up the event. You will be asked to answer some questions, such as how much waste you've collected, if there was a cleanup day held at the location before, if the waste was recycled and how many volunteers were actually present.
This will be used by organisations such as Suresur and the government to get a better view of problems with the current waste disposal system, and allow them to better adresss this in the future.

# Roadmap

1. Adding the app to Google Play Store.
2. Improving the event creation UI.

4. Adding the ability to plan routes to the events.
5. A better event wrap-up experience.
    1. The ability to remove unwanted pictures.
    2. The ability to select pictures from gallery.
